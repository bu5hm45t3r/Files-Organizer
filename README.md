H2<Files Organizer>

Hello there.. i am new to programming but enthusiastic enough to explore and create.
With my curiosity and one of the problem i seen in my circle led me to create this piece of software with the help of Python and Tkinter library.

Welcome to Files Organizer where your files are organized into a folder based on their extension and the date they are created on.
I hope it is simple enough to understand and please feedback me. :-)
